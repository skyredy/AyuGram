// AYG: everything the restricted-forwarding mechanism needs that is *not* storage.
//
// Three separate things live here, in the order the mechanism uses them:
//
// 1. `…IgnoringBypass` — the real, un-lied-to answers. Upstream's `isCopyProtected()`
//    and `Peer.isCopyProtectionEnabled` now return `false` while the setting is on, so
//    the honest values need names of their own: the forward path has to know whether a
//    *plain* forward would actually be refused, and the admin UI has to keep showing the
//    real state of the channel's own "Restrict Saving Content" switch.
//
// 2. `aygRequiresCopyForward` / `aygSupportsCopyForward` — the two halves of AyuGram for
//    Android's `AyuForward.isAyuForwardNeeded` (`AyuMessageUtils.isUnforwardable`) plus
//    the media whitelist its send path can actually reproduce.
//
// 3. `aygCopyForwardEnqueueMessage` — the send itself. This is the part that is not a
//    boolean: `messages.forwardMessages` out of a protected chat is refused **by the
//    server** (`CHAT_FORWARDS_RESTRICTED`), so unlocking the Forward button alone would
//    only produce a failed send. AyuGram's answer, and this one, is to stop forwarding
//    and start *re-sending*: build a brand-new outgoing message carrying the same text
//    and a re-uploaded copy of the media. The `AyuForwardStatusLoadingMedia` string in
//    `docs/AYGAndroidStrings.xml` ("Loading media") is that download-then-reupload step
//    surfacing in Android's UI.
