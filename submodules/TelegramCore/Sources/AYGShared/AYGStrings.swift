// AYG: AyuGram's own translations.
//
// AyuGram for Android keeps its strings in `assets/ayu_locales/values-*/ayu.xml` and
// looks them up by name at runtime; the fork's iOS side does the same thing with the
// same key names, out of flat JSON in `Telegram/Telegram-iOS/AYGLocales/*.json`. Keeping
// the keys identical to the APK's is what makes any string traceable back to its origin.
//
// English and Russian are maintained by hand and are the two complete languages: every
// string this fork can put on screen has an entry in both. The remaining files came from
// AyuGram's Crowdin export and cover only the keys AyuGram itself has — anything this
// fork added falls back to English there, which is the normal behaviour for a partially
// translated app.
//
// Deliberately *not* `.lproj`/`NSLocalizedString`: `AppStringResources` in
// `Telegram/BUILD` bundles a real `en.lproj` plus empty placeholders for every other
// language, because Telegram downloads the rest at runtime. Slotting AyuGram's strings
// into that scheme would mean either fighting the downloader or shipping the one language
// that is not downloaded.
//
// This lives in TelegramCore rather than in AyuGramUI because the strings are needed from
// modules that must not depend on AyuGramUI — the login screen (AuthorizationUI) and the
// story viewer among them. Nothing here touches UIKit, so the Mac codebase's ban on
// UI frameworks in TelegramCore holds.
