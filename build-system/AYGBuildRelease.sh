# AYG: build a release-signed AyuGram IPA, with progress visible while it runs.
#
#   Usage: build-system/AYGBuildRelease.sh adhoc|appstore [extra Make.py args...]
#
# adhoc    — signed with the Ad Hoc profiles, installs straight onto a device
#            registered on the team (currently only the iPhone 15,
#            00008120-000965642292201E). This is the one to use for testing.
# appstore — signed for App Store submission. Cannot be installed directly;
#            it only goes up through TestFlight / App Store Connect.
#
# Both use the distribution certificate (V7N7DGXYAF) whose private key is in
# the login keychain, and the profiles under build-input/codesigning-*/.
#
# Do NOT pipe this through grep to "keep it quiet" — that hides bazel's
# `[N / TOTAL] <action>` progress line, which is the only way to see where a
# 20-minute build actually is.
